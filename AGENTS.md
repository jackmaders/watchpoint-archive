# AI Agent System Guidance & Architecture Rules

This repository enforces strict technical, architectural, and quality standards for all AI pair-programming and automated code generation tasks.

## Core System Rules

### 1. Runtime & Canonical Package Scripts
Always execute workflows using `bun run <script>` and manage packages with `bun add <pkg>`. Consult the canonical script reference below before running tasks:

| Goal / Workflow | Canonical Script |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fast Iteration** (types + lint + arch + unit) | `bun run validate:fast` |
| **Pre-PR Quality Gate** (full check + test + build + deploy dry-run) | `bun run validate` |
| **Auto-fix Formatting & Imports** | `bun run fix:all` |
| **Lint & Format Verification** | `bun run check:all` |
| **Type Verification** | `bun run check:types` |
| **Architecture Verification** (Steiger) | `bun run check:architecture` |
| **Targeted Unit Testing** (single slice/file) | `bun run test:unit <path>` |
| **Full Unit Testing** | `bun run test:unit` |
| **Test Coverage** | `bun run test:coverage` |
| **Database Migration Generation** | `bun run db:generate` |

### 2. Conventional Commits & Branches
- **Branch from Latest Main**: Always sync `main` (`git checkout main && git pull origin main`) and branch from latest `main` before starting new work. Never branch off unmerged feature branches unless managing a stacked PR.
- **Branch Names**: Format branch names strictly as `<type>/<kebab-case-description>` (e.g. `feat/user-profiles`, `fix/manifest-decoding`, `refactor/video-player-component`).
- **Commit Messages**: Format commit messages as `<type>(#<issue-number>): <emoji> <description>` when an issue number is provided, using the issue number as the only scope (e.g. `feat(#123): ✨ add amazing features`). When no issue number is provided, omit the scope entirely (e.g. `chore: 🧹 update documentation`). Commits in this repo are not signed; do not attempt GPG/SSH signing.
- **Pull Request Titles**: Use the same format as commit messages: `<type>(#<issue-number>): <emoji> <description>` when an issue number is provided, or `<type>: <emoji> <description>` when no issue number is provided. Do not use any scope other than the issue number (e.g. `feat(#123): ✨ add amazing features`).

### 3. Dedicated Tooling, Not Ad-Hoc Scripts
- For services with dedicated tooling, use that CLI/MCP server (e.g. `gh` for GitHub, `sentry-cli` for error tracking) — never raw HTTP scripts or ad-hoc curls.
- For local filesystem operations, prefer built-in agent file tools (`view_file`, `replace_file_content`, `write_to_file`, `grep_search`, `list_dir`) over shell commands (`cat`, `sed`, `grep`, `find`).

### 4. Immutable Auto-Generated Database Migrations
- Auto-generated database migration scripts inside `drizzle/` MUST NOT be manually edited. Generate new migrations via `bun run db:generate`.

### 5. Token Efficiency & Output Hygiene
- **Fast Iterative Validation**: Run `bun run validate:fast` (`check:types`, `check:all`, `check:architecture`, `test:unit`) for intermediate development loops. Reserve `bun run validate` for final pre-PR verification.
- **Targeted Test Execution**: Pass specific file or directory paths to `bun run test:unit <path>` during active development (e.g. `bun run test:unit src/pages/vods/`) to keep test cycles fast and token usage minimal.
- **Format Before Check**: Run `bun run fix:all` before `bun run check:all` to resolve formatting and import sorting automatically.
- **Concise Git Invocations**: Use `git status -s` (short status) and `git log -n 5 --oneline` to inspect git state concisely.
