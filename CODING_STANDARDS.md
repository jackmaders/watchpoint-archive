# Coding Standards

This is the file `code-review`'s Standards axis reads. It is the surviving content of the
Developer and Reviewer agent skills deleted in #50 — the parts that describe how code
*should* be written, independent of any specific ticket's requirements. The Spec axis
(does this PR do what the issue asked?) is judged against the issue, not this file.

## Feature-Sliced Design (Pages-First)

- Keep UI components, business logic, and server actions inside the relevant
  `src/pages/<slice-name>/` directory by default.
- Do not extract logic into `features/` or `widgets/` until a second consumer explicitly
  requires it.
- Cross-slice imports go through a slice's public API (`index.ts`) only.
- `bun run check:architecture` (Steiger) enforces this — treat a failure as a real
  violation, not a linter to silence.

## Feature naming — action-first

Features extracted into `src/features/` are named `{action}-{entity}` (verb-noun): `create-user`,
`submit-feedback`. A feature's name describes what it does, not just what it's about.

## Routing directory (`src/app/routes/`) — ultra-thin adapters

Every route file under `src/app/routes/` MUST be an ultra-thin parameter-binding and composition adapter:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { HomePage, loadHomePage } from "@/pages/home";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
	component: HomeRoute,
	loader: loadHomePage,
});

function HomeRoute() {
	const { vods } = Route.useLoaderData();
	return <HomePage vods={vods} />;
}
```

- **Zero Inline Logic**: No state hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`), inline business logic, DOM manipulation, or raw HTML tags.
- **Delegation**: Loaders, beforeLoad auth checks, search param validators, request handlers, and route presentations MUST be delegated to dedicated functions in `src/pages/<slice-name>/` or `src/shared/`.
- **Enforcement**: `plugins/enforce-ultra-thin-routes.grit` enforces this rule via Biome linting.

## Module-Level Documentation (Why-First JSDoc)

Every source file (domain services, UI components, FSD slices, routing adapters, utility modules, and database schemas) MUST begin with a top-of-file, two-paragraph JSDoc module block (`/** ... */`):

1. **The "Why" (Paragraph 1)**: An implementation-agnostic explanation of why the file exists, the domain or architectural problem it solves, and its place in the system. Ground this explanation in repository ubiquitous language (`CONTEXT.md`), architectural standards, or relevant ADRs without mentioning transient implementation details.
2. **The "How" (Paragraph 2)**: Concrete implementation mechanics, exported symbols, runtime dependencies (e.g. Cloudflare D1, Drizzle ORM, TanStack Start, TanStack Router), caching/lifecycles, mutation invariants, and boundary error-handling rules.

Do NOT include explicit section labels or markdown headers (such as `Why:` or `How:`) inside the docblock; the structure is implicit via the two sequential paragraphs.

### Canonical Examples

#### Domain Service / ADR-0010 Database Layer
```ts
/**
 * Coordinates durable attempt recording and completion telemetry for interactive
 * VOD training playthroughs, enforcing idempotent submission and user ownership.
 *
 * Implements the ADR-0010 domain service contract via `playthroughService`. Wraps
 * Drizzle ORM operations against Cloudflare D1 inside transactional boundaries,
 * sanitizes pagination inputs with `escapeLike`, and projects results into `DbResult<T>`.
 */
```

#### Feature-Sliced Design (Pages-First Slice / Component)
```tsx
/**
 * Renders the interactive tactical decision overlay presented when a VOD playback
 * reaches a curated scenario timestamp across all five learning module types.
 *
 * Implements the desktop Tactical Drawer and mobile overlay presentations within the
 * `src/pages/session/` slice. Connects to `useSessionPlayer` to receive scenario manifests,
 * triggers countdown animations, and delegates user submissions to slice actions.
 */
```

#### Ultra-Thin Routing Adapter (`src/app/routes/`)
```tsx
/**
 * Entrypoint route adapter for the interactive VOD training session view.
 *
 * Binds URL parameters and loader data via `@tanstack/react-router` createFileRoute,
 * delegating all data fetching, auth verification, and UI composition to `src/pages/session/`.
 */
```

### Integration Guidelines

- **Anchor in Repository Context**: Reference established domain terminology from `CONTEXT.md` (e.g., *Session Manifest*, *Attempt Outcome*, *Tactical Drawer*), architecture rules from `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, and architectural decisions from `docs/adr/` (e.g., *ADR-0010*).
- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)**: Files inside `src/pages/`, `src/features/`, `src/entities/`, and `src/shared/` must articulate their role in the FSD hierarchy and describe how consumers or cross-slice public APIs interact with them.
- **Ultra-Thin Routes (`src/app/routes/`)**: Route files must document their route binding role and explicitly state the delegated target slice in `src/pages/` or `src/shared/`.
- **Database Queries & Schemas (`src/shared/db/`)**: Must document adherence to the D1/Drizzle architecture (e.g., single-table schemas in `schema/`, per-request client passing from `cloudflare:workers`, query functions in `queries/`, zero business logic or service objects in `shared/db`).

## Test file location

Every unit test file lives in an adjacent `__tests__` directory (matching
`**/__tests__/*.spec.{ts,tsx}`), never beside the source file it tests.

## Test structure — Arrange, Act, Assert

Every test case is organized into three explicit, commented phases:

```ts
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  // Arrange
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }];

  // Act
  const total = calculateTotal(items);

  // Assert
  expect(total).toBe(15);
});
```

No non-assertion statements follow `expect(...)` or `await expect(...)` in a test block.
`plugins/enforce-aaa-assertions.grit` enforces this — see Grit plugin locks below.

Prefer integration-style tests through the public interface over mocking internal
collaborators, and use an independent expected value rather than recomputing the
implementation's own formula:

```ts
// GOOD — independent literal, not the implementation's formula
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }];
  expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(15);
});

// BAD — tautological: expected value recomputes the implementation
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }];
  const expected = items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0);
  expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(expected);
});
```

## Test speed

Every test block executes in under 50ms. A slow test is almost always reaching a real
database, filesystem, or network — replace the dependency at the seam, don't add a
timeout.

## Test coverage

100% coverage — statements, branches, functions, and lines — enforced via
`bun run test:coverage`. There is no partial-coverage carve-out for a slice, a file, or a
line marked "trivial."

## No console output in tests

Tests must not write to `console` (`console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`,
React `act(...)` warnings). Console output during a test run is a failure, not a warning.

## Grit plugin locks

Three Grit plugins are structural locks on this repo's architectural and testing discipline and MUST NOT be
edited, weakened, or extended with bypass exceptions:

- `plugins/enforce-automocking.grit` — see "Manual mocks" below.
- `plugins/enforce-aaa-assertions.grit` — see "Test structure" above.
- `plugins/enforce-ultra-thin-routes.grit` — see "Routing directory" above.


## Manual mocks — `__mocks__` only

Inline manual mock factory overrides (`vi.mock("...", () => ...)`) are prohibited. Every
manual module mock lives in an adjacent `__mocks__` directory instead, so the mock is
discoverable and reusable rather than re-declared per test file.

## Call-site signature tracing

Do not assume a caller passes parameters correctly just because a function's own
signature is valid or its unit tests pass in isolation. For every function or helper
touched in a change, trace every invocation site across the diff *and* the rest of the
codebase, and verify the caller's arguments actually match the updated signature.
Unit tests frequently call a function directly with hand-built parameters — that proves
the function works when called correctly, not that the production entrypoint (a runner,
an event handler, a route) actually calls it that way.

## No spaghetti conditionals

Reject ad-hoc `if` statements, scattered special cases, or edge-case flags dropped into
an otherwise linear execution path. Encapsulate variant behaviour into a dedicated
helper, state machine, or policy object instead of branching further at the call site.

## Biome Complexity & Function Limits

Biome enforces strict cognitive and length limits on every function and React component:
- **Max Lines Per Function**: 80 lines (`noExcessiveLinesPerFunction`).
- **Max Cognitive Complexity**: 10 (`noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity`).

Structure components proactively into cohesive, modular subcomponents, extracted custom hooks, and pure calculation helpers rather than creating oversized functions that require subsequent refactoring.

## Testing Library: Selector Disambiguation

When testing DOM trees where the same label or name appears across multiple UI elements (such as `<select>` dropdown options, badge pills, and card titles), use targeted queries to avoid ambiguity:
- Prefer semantic role queries with accessible names: `screen.getByRole("combobox", { name: /filter by hero/i })`, `screen.getByRole("link", { name: /start training/i })`.
- Use container-scoped queries (`within(card).getByText(...)`) or `screen.getAllByText(...)` when identical strings render in multiple UI regions.

## File size guard

No file grows past 1,000 lines without extracting subcomponents or helper modules. Keep
FSD slices (`src/pages/<slice-name>/`) modular and focused rather than letting one file
absorb everything a slice needs.

## Database Services & D1 Error Handling Standards

### Layered Database Architecture
- The database subsystem is organized into three explicit layers under `src/shared/db/`:
  - `src/shared/db/core/`: Foundational infrastructure (D1 client/context, `DbResult<T>`, error mapping, `escapeLike`, pagination & sorting helpers).
  - `src/shared/db/schema/`: Drizzle table declarations, relations, and enums (`audit.ts`, `auth.ts`, `playthroughs.ts`, `vods.ts`, `index.ts`).
  - `src/shared/db/services/`: Cohesive domain service objects (`vods.service.ts`, `auth.service.ts`, `audit.service.ts`, `playthroughs.service.ts`).
- Drizzle acts as the internal data-mapping engine. All database access must flow through typed domain service objects (e.g. `vodService`, `authService`, `auditService`, `playthroughService`). Zero direct Drizzle imports or query operations are permitted outside `src/shared/db/`.

### Service Object Contracts & Method Naming
- **Domain Service Objects**: Each domain exports a cohesive service object (e.g. `vodService`, `authService`) containing standard CRUD and domain workflow operations.
- **Return Type Contract**: All service methods return `Promise<DbResult<T>>` (`{ success: true, data: T } | { success: false, error: string }`).
- **Single Record Queries**: Use `getById(id, context?)` or `getBy<Field>(value, context?)`. Returns `Promise<DbResult<T | null>>` (returns `data: null`, never throws on not-found).
- **Collection Queries**: Use `list<Entities>(options?, context?)` or `list(options?, context?)`. Returns `Promise<DbResult<T[]>>` or `Promise<DbResult<PaginatedResult<T>>>`.
- **Existence & Metrics**: Use `exists(options, context?)` (`Promise<DbResult<boolean>>`) and `count(options?, context?)` (`Promise<DbResult<number>>`).
- **Standard Mutations**:
  - `create(input, context?)`: Inserts a single record. Returns `Promise<DbResult<T>>`.
  - `update(id, input, context?)`: Updates a single record. Returns `Promise<DbResult<T>>`.
  - `upsert(input, context?)`: Inserts or updates a record based on unique constraints. Returns `Promise<DbResult<T>>`.
  - `delete(id, context?)`: Deletes a single record. Returns `Promise<DbResult<void>>` or `Promise<DbResult<boolean>>`.
- **Complex Domain Workflows**: Named with action-first business verbs (`publishVod`, `reorderScenarios`, `changeUserRole`, `recordPlaythroughAttempt`, `completePlaythrough`).

### Pagination & Query Sanitization Standards
- **Standard Pagination Envelope**: Paginated collection queries return `PaginatedResult<T>` (`{ items: T[], page: number, pageSize: number, total: number, totalPages: number }`). Page size is clamped to `[1, 50]` (default 10).
- **Deterministic Sort Tiebreakers**: Every offset-paginated query must append the primary key (`desc(table.id)`) to prevent row duplication/skipping.
- **LIKE Sanitization**: All string search inputs must be passed through `escapeLike(query)` from `core/query.ts` to escape `%`, `_`, and `\` wildcards.
- **Forced Boundary Scopes**: Tenancy, ownership (`userId`), and visibility (`isPublished = true`) filters must be enforced in private service helpers.

### D1Error & SQLite Error Handling
- Catch raw Drizzle / D1 exceptions and map or verify against standard `D1ErrorCode` constants / SQLite error codes (e.g. `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE = 2067`, `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY = 787`, `SQLITE_BUSY = 5`).
- Query operations return `data: null` or `data: []` on missing records and only return failures on genuine D1 infrastructure errors.
- Mutation operations catch constraint violations to distinguish predictable conflicts (e.g. unique constraint collision) from fatal infrastructure failures.
- Server-side error monitoring (Sentry) and client-side UI error notifications (Toasts) are isolated at server function (`server-fns.ts`) and client mutation boundaries (`MutationCache` / `QueryCache`).
